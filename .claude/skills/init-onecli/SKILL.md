# Initialize OneCLI Agent Vault

This skill installs OneCLI, configures the Agent Vault gateway, and migrates any existing `.env` credentials into it.

**Principle:** When something is broken or missing, fix it. Don't tell the user to go fix it themselves unless it genuinely requires their manual action (e.g. pasting a token).

## Phase 1: Pre-flight

### Check if OneCLI is already working

```bash
onecli version 2>/dev/null
```

If the command succeeds, OneCLI is installed. Check if the gateway is reachable:

```bash
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:10254/health
```

If both succeed, check for an Anthropic secret:

```bash
onecli secrets list
```

If an Anthropic secret exists, tell the user OneCLI is already configured and working. Use AskUserQuestion:

1. **Keep current setup** — description: "OneCLI is installed and has credentials configured. Nothing to do."
2. **Reconfigure** — description: "Start fresh — reinstall OneCLI and re-register credentials."

If they choose to keep, skip to Phase 5 (Verify). If they choose to reconfigure, continue.

### Check for native credential proxy

```bash
grep "credential-proxy" src/index.ts 2>/dev/null
```

If `startCredentialProxy` is imported, the native credential proxy skill is active. Tell the user: "You're currently using the native credential proxy (`.env`-based). This skill will switch you to OneCLI's Agent Vault, which adds per-agent policies and rate limits. Your `.env` credentials will be migrated to the vault."

Use AskUserQuestion:
1. **Continue** — description: "Switch to OneCLI Agent Vault."
2. **Cancel** — description: "Keep the native credential proxy."

If they cancel, stop.

### Check the codebase expects OneCLI

```bash
grep "@onecli-sh/sdk" package.json
```

If `@onecli-sh/sdk` is NOT in package.json, the codebase hasn't been updated to use OneCLI yet. Tell the user to run `/update-conclaw` first to get the OneCLI integration, then retry `/init-onecli`. Stop here.

## Phase 2: Install OneCLI

### Install the gateway and CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL onecli.sh/install | sh
curl -fsSL onecli.sh/cli/install | sh
```

Verify: `onecli version`

If the command is not found, the CLI was likely installed to `~/.local/bin/`. Add it to PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
grep -q '.local/bin' ~/.bashrc 2>/dev/null || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
grep -q '.local/bin' ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Re-verify with `onecli version`.

### Configure the CLI

Point the CLI at the local OneCLI instance:

```bash
onecli config set api-host http://127.0.0.1:10254
```

### Set ONECLI_URL in .env

```bash
grep -q 'ONECLI_URL' .env 2>/dev/null || echo 'ONECLI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:10254' >> .env
```

### Wait for gateway readiness

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 15); do
  curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:10254/health && break
  sleep 1
done
```

## Phase 3: Migrate existing credentials

### Scan .env for credentials to migrate

Read the `.env` file and look for these credential variables:

| .env variable | OneCLI secret type | Host pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `anthropic` | `api.anthropic.com` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | `anthropic` | `api.anthropic.com` |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | `anthropic` | `api.anthropic.com` |

For each credential found, migrate it to OneCLI:

```bash
onecli secrets create --name Anthropic --type anthropic --value <key> --host-pattern api.anthropic.com
```

After successful migration, remove the credential lines from `.env`. Keep all other `.env` entries intact (e.g. `ONECLI_URL`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`).

Verify: `onecli secrets list`

## Phase 4: Build and restart

```bash
npm run build
```

Restart the service:
- macOS (launchd): `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.conclaw`
- Linux (systemd): `systemctl --user restart conclaw`

## Phase 5: Verify

Check logs for successful OneCLI integration:

```bash
tail -30 logs/conclaw.log | grep -i "onecli\|gateway"
```

Tell the user:
- OneCLI Agent Vault is now managing credentials
- Agents never see raw API keys — credentials are injected at the gateway level
- To manage secrets: `onecli secrets list`, or open http://127.0.0.1:10254
- To add rate limits or policies: `onecli rules create --help`

## Troubleshooting

**"OneCLI gateway not reachable" in logs:** The gateway isn't running. Check with `curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:10254/health`. Start it with `onecli start` if needed.

**Container gets no credentials:** Verify `ONECLI_URL` is set in `.env` and the gateway has an Anthropic secret (`onecli secrets list`).

**Port 10254 already in use:** Another OneCLI instance may be running. Check with `lsof -i :10254` and kill the old process.
