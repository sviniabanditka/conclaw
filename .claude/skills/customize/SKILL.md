# ConClaw Customization

This skill helps users add capabilities or modify behavior. Use AskUserQuestion to understand what they want before making changes.

## Workflow

1. **Understand the request** - Ask clarifying questions
3. **Plan the changes** - Identify files to modify. If a skill exists for the request (e.g., `/add-telegram` for adding Telegram), invoke it instead of implementing manually.
4. **Implement** - Make changes directly to the code
5. **Test guidance** - Tell user how to verify

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/registry.ts` | Channel registry (self-registration at startup) |
| `src/ipc.ts` | IPC watcher and task processing |
| `src/router.ts` | Message formatting and outbound routing |
| `src/types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces (includes Channel) |
| `src/config.ts` | Assistant name, trigger pattern, directories |
| `src/db.ts` | Database initialization and queries |
| `groups/CLAUDE.md` | Global memory/persona |

## Common Customization Patterns

### Adding a New MCP Integration

Questions to ask:
- What service? (Calendar, Notion, database, etc.)
- What operations needed? (read, write, both)
- Which groups should have access?

Implementation:
1. Add MCP server config to the container settings (see `src/container-runner.ts` for how MCP servers are mounted)
2. Document available tools in `groups/CLAUDE.md`

### Changing Assistant Behavior

Questions to ask:
- What aspect? (name, trigger, persona, response style)
- Apply to all groups or specific ones?

Simple changes → edit `src/config.ts`
Persona changes → edit `groups/CLAUDE.md`
Per-group behavior → edit specific group's `CLAUDE.md`

### Adding New Commands

Questions to ask:
- What should the command do?
- Available in all groups or main only?
- Does it need new MCP tools?

Implementation:
1. Commands are handled by the agent naturally — add instructions to `groups/CLAUDE.md` or the group's `CLAUDE.md`
2. For trigger-level routing changes, modify `processGroupMessages()` in `src/index.ts`

### Changing Deployment

Questions to ask:
- Target platform? (Linux server, Docker, different Mac)
- Service manager? (systemd, Docker, supervisord)

Implementation:
1. Create appropriate service files
2. Update paths in config
3. Provide setup instructions

## After Changes

Always tell the user:
```bash
# Rebuild and restart
npm run build
# macOS:
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.conclaw.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.conclaw.plist
# Linux:
# systemctl --user restart conclaw
```
